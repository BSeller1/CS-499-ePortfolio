  <!-- PROFESSIONAL SELF-ASSESSMENT -->
  <section id="self">
    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
    <p class="subhead">
      Reflecting on my growth as a computer science professional and alignment to program outcomes. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout my time in the Computer Science program at SNHU, I have developed a strong foundation
      in software engineering, algorithms and data structures, databases, and secure coding practices. 
      By completing the coursework and developing the ePortfolio artifacts, I have had the chance to reflect
      on my technical growth. Most importantly, I have demonstrated by ability to evaluate and enhance complex
      solutions with a focus on maintainability, security, and data-driven features.
    </p>

    <p>
      This ePortfolio process has strenghtened my skills in assessing existing codebases, planning improvements,
      implementing enhancements, and documenting outcomes. Revisiting coursework artifacts has allowed me to 
      identify inefficiencies, scalability concerns, and design flaws that are encountered frequently in the real-world. 
      This process has reinforced the importance of clean code, maintainability, user-centered design, securing coding practices, and 
      continuous learning in this profession. 
    </p>

    <p>
      My coursework frequently required me to collaborate and communicate with peers, instructors, and stakeholders.
      I have learned how to articulate technical concepts clearly, incorporate feedback, and coordinate constraints with useability considerations.
      These skills are reflected across the portfolio artifacts; more specifically, in fullstack and database applications that coordinate client-server interactions. 
      This resulted in a strengthened understanding of data structures and algorithms. I applied algorithmic reasoning to improve query efficiency, pagination, and filtering behavior. 
      I devloped strong foundations in refactoring legacy code, migrating application to more modern frameworks, and enforced modular design principles enhancing maintainability and scalability. 
      I gained experience working with SQL and NoSQL systems, implementing CRUD operations, and optimizing data retrieval
      through aggregation pipelines and indexing strategies. These skills are demonstrated in the database-driven artifact, which showcases my ability to design efficient schemas and interact with databases securely.
    </p>

    <p>
      The artifacts included in this portfolio show my growth as a computer science professional and my alignment to the program outcomes.
      Each artifact highlighted a different part of my technical development such as mobile application engineering, 
      algorithmic efficiency, database integration, and secure coding practices. Overall, this portfolio reflects what I have built, learned, and refunded throughout my studies.

  <!-- REFINEMENT PLAN-->

    <h2>Refinement Plan and Code Review</h2>
    <p class="subhead">
      Pre-enhancement evaluation of functionality, risks, and planned improvements aligned to CS-499 outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before I implemented enhancements to each artifact, I evaluated functionality, maintainability, security, and alignment to program outcomes.
      The refinement plan for each artifact identified enhancement goals before the enhancement process began. The goal was to
      modernized legacy code, improve algorithmic efficiency, and strengthen database integration while following secure coding practices.
      The enhancements were selected to demonstrate competencies aligned to the CS-499 program outcomes. This process reflects industry-standard practices where legacy
      systems are evaluated and improved to meet evolving requirements.

      <h3>Enhancement Narrative</h3>

      <p>
        This artifact is from CS-360: Mobile Architecture and Programming as an Android-based
        inventory management application written in Java. The application supports core inventory
        functionality, including item tracking and user authentication.
        The enhancement resulted in the application migrating from Java to Kotlin to 
        modernize the codebase and align it with current Android development standards.
      </p>

      <p>
        To demonstrate improved software design and engineering principles, I focused on refactoring the existing
        codebase from Java to Kotlin. This required a deep understanding of both languages to ensure the applications functionality
        was kept intact. This showed my ability to work with legacy code, modernize applications, and apply best practices in mobile development.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through the enhancement process, I learned that language migration is not just about syntax changes,
        but about structural and architectural changes too. Automated conversion tools
        assisted with the initial migration; however, maintaining application behavior required quite a bit of
        debugging, testing, and validation. One significant challenge involved correcting
        navigation flow issues, including an unintended login loop, which reinforced the
        importance of understanding control flow and thoroughly testing user interactions.

      </div>

      <h3>Enhancement Narrative (Algorithms & Data Structures)</h3>
      <p>
        This artifact is from CS-340: Client-Server Developent that focused on Python CRUD module integration with
        a MongoDB database and a Jupyter Dash dashboard. The enhancement redesigned the application to use the MEAN stack
        (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) to improve client-server interactions, data handling, and scalability when working
        with larger datasets. 
      </p>

      <p>
        This artifact was chosen to demonstrate my ability to work with data structures and algorithms in a full-stack application to improve
        data processing, filtering, and user interactions. I implemented server-side filtering and fast data retrieval using MongoDB aggregation 
        pipelines. Thus ultimately, improving performance when working with larger datasets. 
      </p>

      <p>
        This enhancement showcased the importance of designing systems to handle real-world data volumes. I had challenges with
        inefficient table rendering and filtering performance. To address these issues, I implemented pagination, optimized data retrieval with
        aggregation pipelines, and restructured the frontend to efficiently manage user interactions.This artifact ultimately aligns with CS-499 outcomes
        related to data structures, algorithms, and secure coding practices.

      <h3>Enhancement Narrative (Databases)</h3>
      <p>
        This artifact builds upon the previous MEAN stack enhancement by focusing on advanced database concepts.
        I expanded the MongoDB usage through aggregation pipelines, data mining concepts, and structured reporting
        to identify trends in animal outcomes. 
      </p>

      <p>
        This artifact was chosen to show my ability to design and enhance database-driven application beyond basic CRUD operations.
        I implemented complex aggregation pipelines to generate reports and insights from the data, demonstrating my understanding of database optimization thus
        showing my skills in NoSQL design and data analysis in fullstack applications. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I faced several challenges in predictive analytics and data accuracy. To overcome these, I refined aggregation queries,
        validated data integrity, and ensured efficient indexing strategies. This artifact aligns with CS-499 outcomes related to database design,
        communication, collaboration, and database tools. I hope to further expand the capabilities of this application in future work.
